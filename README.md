wolfram ca in python. with a string print display 
# Wolfram rules are just binary numbers
 eg rule 30 = 00011110  is just 30 in binary
   
  but when we are looking at neighbors and truning and converting their binary
  values to a decimal index 0 -7  they are reversed 
  example: 111 gives us the 128 rule which is in our list index 0 
   binary 111 is 7 so we much subtract to get the right index.
